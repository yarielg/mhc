# MHC â€“ WordPress Plugin

This WordPress plugin is designed for a behavioral clinic that provides services to children with autism and other conditions affecting behavior.
It integrates a custom payroll management system that allows administrators to generate detailed payslips for different worker roles â€” RBTs (technicians), BCaBAs (intermediate), and BCBAs (analysts) â€” based on hours worked with each patient, specific rates (general or per patient), and exceptional payments or deductions.

The system is built as a Vue-powered single-page application (SPA) embedded in WordPress via shortcodes. It is optimized to minimize the number of clicks needed to produce payrolls, while still supporting complex scenarios such as:

Assigning and calculating extra payments or deductions.

Managing fixed-rate activities like assessments and supervision.

Handling exceptions where certain workers skip payroll cycles.

Generating individual payslips for each worker with detailed breakdowns of payments by category.

Producing global payroll reports for internal verification and comparison with accounting systems.

By combining a modern Vue frontend with a WordPress backend, the plugin allows secure access from any location, detailed role/patient management, and automated calculations that reduce human error and manual work.
